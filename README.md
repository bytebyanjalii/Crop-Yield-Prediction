🌾 Crop Yield Prediction System using Machine Learning 🌾

I have developed a Crop Yield Prediction System 🤖🌱 leveraging supervised machine learning techniques to accurately forecast agricultural output for a specified region. The predictive model utilizes a diverse set of input features including:

   ↦  📅 Year (temporal indicator of data collection)

   ↦  🌧️ Average Annual Rainfall (in millimeters)

   ↦  🧪 Pesticide Usage (in tonnes)

   ↦  🌡️ Average Temperature

   ↦  🗺️ Area (representing the country or region)

   ↦  🌽 Item (denoting the specific crop cultivated)

To evaluate model performance, we implemented and compared four regression-based algorithms:
📈 Linear Regression,
📉 Lasso Regression,
📊 Ridge Regression, and
🌳 Decision Tree Regressor.

Among these, the Decision Tree Regressor 🌳 demonstrated the best performance, achieving a predictive accuracy of 97% ✅ — effectively capturing complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

🎯 The primary objective of this model is to support data-driven agricultural planning. It enables informed decision-making for:

👨‍🌾 Farmers

🌿 Agronomists

🏛️ Policymakers

By providing accurate and timely crop yield estimates, this system contributes to optimizing 🌾 resource allocation, reducing risks ⚠️, and strengthening food security 🥗 on both local and national levels.
